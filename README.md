This tutorial will demo how to set up a bare bones 
API using mongodb as the database.

It consist of a User model and controller. The model
defines the data, and the controller will contain all 
the user routes  which interact with the database.

connect the app to the database;

The server file is used to spin up the server and tells the
app to listen on a specific port.
